	<blockquote cite="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">
	A buildingâ€™s foundation defines its footprint, which defines its frame, which shapes the facade. Each phase of the architectural process is more immutable, more unchanging than the last. Creative decisions quite literally shape a physical space, defining the way in which people move through its confines for decades or even centuries.
